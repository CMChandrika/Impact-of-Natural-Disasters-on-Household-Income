Impact of Natural Disasters on Household Income: Evidence from Household Survey

Abstract: Bangladesh is the planetâ€™s sixth most vulnerable country to natural disasters and climate change, affected by 232 natural disasters from 1980-2010, and consequently, loss human lives and economic resources. Given the ubiquity of natural disasters and significant economic loses, this paper seeks to understand the impact of natural disasters on family income using Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2010 data. Four types of natural disasters, namely Drought, Flood, Landslides and Earthquake, are considered in this study to quantify their impact on household income. This study, using matching estimator, finds that disasters negatively affect households and, on an average, decrease family income by 28 per cent yearly. Finding remains robust even after controlling for economic, demographic, and geographical factors. The quantiles of treatment shows that the nature of disasters (Drought, Flood, Landslides and Earthquake) is different for different income groups. Briefly, the inferential statistical evidence suggests a significant negative association between natural disasters and family income robust both in the conditional mean and quantile framework.
